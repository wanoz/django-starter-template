# Django starter template

## Background and motivation
Learning to code can be fun and rewarding. When building our own apps, we typically get into a "zone" of acquiring and reinforcing the knowledge through rapid implementation and experimentation. But for people who code infrequently and/or are doing different things in different phases (not recommended if wanting to become a good developer) - it can become difficult to remember particular syntax or code patterns after not touching the code for a while. Sites like Stackoverflow and just Googling stuff in general help with this problem immensely. Nevertheless, sometimes the initial barrier of trying to dig up old projects and trying to call how things work and where things are may be enough to discourage some of us from exploring that new opportunity. Thus, think of this as a "hello world" of Django app development that one can get it up and running quickly.

## Few comments on Django
- Django is a relatively mature back-end Python framework for server, web development.
- Django's official documentation is known to be very high in quality (with numerous useful tutorials available online).
- Django is written in Python (and Python is a general programming language, that as of 2018, has seen an increase in its popularity not just in the programming community. but a huge increase in the analytics and machine learning community). See the official documentation at: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/
